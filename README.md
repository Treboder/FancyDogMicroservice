# Getting Started
Simple example demonstrating automatically created REST endpoints via spring-boot-starter-data-rest.
Implementation creates a REST service for a simple data class <Dog> without the need to write separate controller or any other service.
We also register the service to a running Eureka instance, so make sure that Eureka is already running (http://localhost:8761/).

Navigate to http://localhost:8762/dogs to see the exposed dog microservice.  

## Operations

### GET (in order to retrieve list of prices)
```
http://localhost:8762/dogs
```
### GET (in order to retrieve a certain price by id)
```
http://localhost:8762/dogs/1
``` 
### POST (in order to save a new price)
```
http://localhost:8762/dogs/
``` 
with following JSON payload:
```      
    {
        "name" : "Rex",
        "breed" : "Sch√§ferhund",
        "origin" : "Deutschland"
    }
```

### DELETE (a certain price by id)
```
http://localhost:8762/dogs/1
```

### PUT (in order to update a certain price by id)
```
http://localhost:8762/dogs/1
```

### ToDo: Find solution for Eureka showing host.docker.internal instead of ip
